Service Management Processes
============================

This is an experiment to see if we can use Github for managing the versions of our Service Management processes while also including the voices of many, many people. Can we collectively create something awesome, within the context of the Service Management objectives? Let's see.

While learning about how to use this tool, we'll first try it out with just us ITS Service Management process owners. Once we understand how to use it fully we can open it up to the rest of the community.
